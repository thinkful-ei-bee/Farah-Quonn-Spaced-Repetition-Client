# Spaced Repetition Capstone
What is [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)?
A learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological [Spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect).

We have incoporated Spaced Repetition into this application to help users learn French!!!. Users will be shown a series of words, and asked to translate each one. Words, that are correctly translated are repeated with a lesser frequency, and incorrectly translated words, are repeated more frequently. An incorrect and correct count is tallied and displayed for each indiviual word, and these indivual scores are used to create a total score for the session, which is displayed on the learning page.
